excerpt: 'Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplish-
ing complex objectives through the collaborative efforts of
individual agents. Among the methodologies employed in MAS,
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as
one of the most efficacious algorithms. However, when con-
fronted with the complex objective of Formation Control with
Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an effective reward
function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy network
to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving
large language models (LLMs) on the prioritization of tasks
and the observable information available to each agent, our
framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically
adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing
more advanced evaluation metrics rather than the rewards
themselves. This mechanism enables the MAS to simultaneously
achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic
environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iter-
ations to reach superior performance levels. Our empirical
studies, conducted in both simulation and real-world settings,
validate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed
approach.'
