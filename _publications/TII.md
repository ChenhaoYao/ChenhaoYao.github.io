excerpt: 'Multiagent formation obstacle avoidance
is a crucial research topic in the field of multiagent
cooperative control, and deep reinforcement learning has
shown remarkable potential in this domain. However, most
existing studies are not fully distributed and often involve
relatively simple scenarios. In this article, we propose an
advanced method based on multiagent deep reinforcement
learning to address formation and obstacle avoidance in
dynamic obstacles environments. For handling complex
environments with an unknown number of obstacles, we
use long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to encode
dynamic obstacles, thereby improving the efficiency
of obstacle avoidance. Our method achieves formation
and obstacle avoidance in scenarios with both dynamic
and static obstacles, where agents coordinate through
fully independent and autonomous decision-making. We
utilize the multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)
algorithm for centralized training and distributed execution,
enhancing the agentsâ€™ formation and obstacle avoidance
capabilities in complex settings. Through simulation and
real-world experiments, and by comparing with benchmark
methods, we demonstrate significant improvements in
formation effectiveness and obstacle avoidance success
rates, showcasing the superiority and practicality of our
proposed approach.'
